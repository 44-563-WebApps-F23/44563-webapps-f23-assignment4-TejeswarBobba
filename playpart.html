    <h1>Tejeswar Bobba acts in a Play</h1>
    <h4>Name of the Play: <i>Hedda Gabler</i>, Author: <i>Henrik Ibsen</i></h4>
    <p>
       <h3 class="hedda">HEDDA:</h3>
       <p class="speech">I have heard the news already, as you see. Tesman sent me a card.</p>
       <h3 class = "misstesman">MISS TESMAN:</h3>
       <p class="speech">Yes, he promised me he would. But nevertheless I thought that to
        Hedda--here in the house of life--I ought myself to bring the tidings of
        death.</p>
        <h3 class="hedda">HEDDA:</h3>
        <p class="speech">That was very kind of you.</p>
        <h3 class="misstesman">MISS TESMAN:</h3>
        <p class="speech ">Ah, Rina ought not to have left us just now. This is not the time for
        Hedda's house to be a house of mourning.</p>
        <h3 class="hedda">HEDDA:</h3>
        <p class="direction">[Changing the subject.]</p><p class="speech">She died quite peacefully, did she not, Miss
        Tesman?</p>
        <h3 class="misstesman">MISS TESMAN:</h3>
        <p class="speech">Oh, her end was so calm, so beautiful. And then she had the unspeakable
        happiness of seeing George once more--and bidding him good-bye.--Has he
        not come home yet?</p>
        <h3 class="hedda">HEDDA:</h3>
        <p class="speech">No. He wrote that he might be detained. But won't you sit down?</p>
        <h3 class="misstesman">MISS TESMAN:</h3>
        <p class="speech">thank you, my dear, dear Hedda. I should like to, but I have so much
        to do. I must prepare my dear one for her rest as well as I can. She
        shall go to her grave looking her best.</p> 
        <h3 class="hedda">HEDDA:</h3>
        <p class="speech">Can I not help you in any way?</p>
        <h3 class="misstesman">MISS TESMAN:</h3>
        <p class="speech">Oh, you must not think of it! Hedda Tesman must have no hand in such
        mournful work. Nor let her thought dwell on it either--not at this time.</p>

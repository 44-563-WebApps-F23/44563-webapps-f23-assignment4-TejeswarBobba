    <h1>Tejeswar Bobba acts in a Play</h1>
    <h4>Name of the Play: <i>Hedda Gabler</i>, Author: <i>Henrik Ibsen</i></h4>
    <p>
       <h3>HEDDA:</h3>
       <p>I have heard the news already, as you see. Tesman sent me a card.</p>
       <h3>MISS TESMAN:</h3>
       <p>Yes, he promised me he would. But nevertheless I thought that to
        Hedda--here in the house of life--I ought myself to bring the tidings of
        death.</p>
        <h3>HEDDA:</h3>
        <p>That was very kind of you.</p>
        <h3>MISS TESMAN:</h3>
        <p>Ah, Rina ought not to have left us just now. This is not the time for
        Hedda's house to be a house of mourning.</p>
        <h3>HEDDA:</h3>
        <p>[Changing the subject.]</p><p>She died quite peacefully, did she not, Miss
        Tesman?</p>
        <h3>MISS TESMAN:</h3>
        <p>Oh, her end was so calm, so beautiful. And then she had the unspeakable
        happiness of seeing George once more--and bidding him good-bye.--Has he
        not come home yet?</p>
        <h3>HEDDA:</h3>
        <p>xNo. He wrote that he might be detained. But won't you sit down?</p>
        <h3>MISS TESMAN:</h3>
        <p>thank you, my dear, dear Hedda. I should like to, but I have so much
        to do. I must prepare my dear one for her rest as well as I can. She
        shall go to her grave looking her best.</p> 
        <h3>HEDDA:</h3>
        <p>Can I not help you in any way?</p>
        <h3>MISS TESMAN:</h3>
        <p>Oh, you must not think of it! Hedda Tesman must have no hand in such
        mournful work. Nor let her thought dwell on it either--not at this time.</p>
